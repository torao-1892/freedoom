E1TEXT = You've made it out of the outpost.\n\
         But you're still stuck on this rock.\n\
         AGM sure has been busy with their\n\
         "experiments", with those monsters\n\
         infesting that dreadful place. You are\n\
         an experiment as well, so who cares?\n\
         There weren't any ships inside the\n\
         outpost. The only section that might\n\
         have one is the Military Labs. The\n\
         very place you got your strength\n\
         from. Damned AGM scientists.\n\n\
         This nightmare is too much. You\n\
         step through the massive doors of\n\
         the Military Labs.\n\n\
         There could be a way to escape in there.
E2TEXT = The massive brutes collapse onto\n\
         the ground. They fall apart bit by bit.\n\
         Unfortunately, there was a no ship\n\
         here either. The Labs have bizarre\n\
         technology though. Like this one.\n\n\
         A huge teleporter machine, set for...\n\
         A place called Horizon?\n\n\
         You never heard of such thing before.\n\
         Maybe it's another AGM facility.\n\
         Meaning there could be a ship on\n\
         the other side. Sounds like a good\n\
         plan. Or at least, as good as it gets.\n\n\
         Next stop, Horizon.
E3TEXT = The abomination explodes into\n\
         oblivion. That's that. Horizon is a\n\
         whole new world, not a facility.\n\
         Even worse than the outpost you\n\
         rotted away for years in. Meaning\n\
         you're still trapped.\n\n\
         An AGM teleporter is here somehow.\n\
         They must have been here then.\n\
         The teleporter is set for a facility\n\
         called "Double Impact", which is a\n\
         ridiculous name. Who cares? All\n\
         you need is a working ship.\n\n\
         You drop all your weapons on\n\
         the ground and step on the platform,\n\
         reintegrating on Double Impact.
E4TEXT = Despite fighting an army of monsters\n\
         you managed to find a ship here.\n\
         Looks like freedom is yours.\n\n\
         "Time to get out of here."\n\
         You tell yourself and plump down\n\
         on the comfortable chair.\n\n\
         The ship rumbles as she wakes up.\n\
         As you lift off, you think of Earth.\n\n\
         Hopefully, AGM won't find you there.\n\
         They've got the outbreak to deal\n\
         with, so that'll give you some time.\n\n\
         Destination: Earth
# After MAP06, before MAP07:
C1TEXT = You've found your way to the\n\
         complex's outer storage warehouse.\n\
         Not even Earth was safe from the\n\
         monsters. This AGM space terminal\n\
         is a lost cause. Best to get out.\n\n\
         You press the panel to call the lift.\n\
         It slowly lowers, then speeds up.\n\
         Growls come along with it.\n\
         Looks like you're not alone here.\n\n\
         Planted your feet.\n\n\
         Checked your weapons.\n\n\
         Time to go up.
# After MAP11, before MAP12:
C2TEXT = The facility is gone, no doubt there.\n\
         You didn't find anyone alive.\n\
         But you don't want to keep fighting\n\
         either. You are only human.\n\
         There's a teleporter here, set for\n\
         a city unknown to you. City means\n\
         people, right?\n\n\
         The bolts holding the platform\n\
         flies off over the ledge. The place\n\
         is falling apart. You quickly step on\n\
         the platform and reappear at the city\n\
         It's been destroyed to the ground.\n\n\
         You can't go back either.
# After MAP20, before MAP21:
C3TEXT = There is no AGM here. no humans.\n\
         Just monsters and monsters.\n\
         And you.\n\
         This could be the beginning of\n\
         your freedom.\n\
         The finale of this endless fighting\n\
         against the monsters.\n\
         No man has ever survived in this\n\
         wasteland.\n\n\
         Other than you, that is.\n\
         Maybe AGM saw this place.\n\
         But never got through here.\n\
         Either way, it doesn't matter.\n\n\
         You're stuck here once again.
# After MAP30 (endgame text):
C4TEXT = The evil thing becomes unstable.\n\n\
         Its final roars echoes throughout the\n\
         room till it crumples into scrap metal.\n\
         A portal opens up, and in it, you see a\n\
         small town. You jump in quickly.\n\
         AGM learned its lesson this time.\n\n\
         Hopefully.\n\n\
         No one will know know who saved them.\n\n\
         No one will know what happened here.\n\n\
         No one will ever find you again.
# Before MAP31 (secret level #1):
C5TEXT = You step onto the machine and\n\
         after a strange flash you find\n\
         yourself in a rusty cage.\n\n\
         "What is this place?"\n\n\
         Before you can wonder further\n\
         you see monsters all around\n\
         you. It's a trap.\n\n\
         You silently bring out\n\
         your gun, ready to kill.
# Before MAP32 (secret level #2):
C6TEXT = The world dissipitates around\n\
         you. You got out of that trap. Only\n\
         to find yourself inside another.\n\
         As the glow of the teleporter\n\
         subsides, it looks like you may\n\
         have made a wrong turn. Again.\n\n\
         "Not again."\n\n\
         The world comes back to you.\n\
         The monsters you fought before\n\
         raise their weapons,\n\n\
         aiming for your head.
