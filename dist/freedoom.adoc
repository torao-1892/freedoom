NAME
----
freedoom - Automatically launch Freedoom with an engine

SYNOPSIS
--------
*freedoom* ['-p' 'PORT'|'--'] ['ARGS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Freedoom is a project to create a complete free-content game based on
the 'Doom' engine (often called “source ports” or simply “ports”),
which itself is free software.  In addition, it maintains
compatibility with 'Doom' itself and is capable of playing the wide
variety of modifications (“mods”) that have been released by an
active community since 1993.

This command is a simple shell script to assist in running Freedoom,
which is not a game engine itself nor part of any engine project, but
playing Freedoom should remain simple.  Only accepted as the first
argument, you may pass '-p PORT', which will run Freedoom using the
'PORT' specified.  As an alternative, you may make a symbolic link
named +$HOME/.doomport+ to your preferred port.  A port specified on
the command line explicitly overrides +$HOME/.doomport+, whereas the
existence of the symbolic link will override the detection of port
based on a hard-coded list.

Additional arguments passed to the program, or after specifying '--'
as the first option, will be passed to the engine being called.  This
can allow you to use options such as '-file' to load mods or anything
else available with the engine of choice.
